# Personal Page Prototypes - Research Graph Application

This repository contains four rapid prototypes for the **Personal Page** feature of the Research Graph application, focusing on starred papers, folder structure, and AI-powered recommendations.

## Feature Overview
The Personal Page allows users to:
- Manage their starred research papers
- Organize papers into folders by topic
- View library statistics and activity
- Receive AI-powered recommendations
- Access personalized learning paths

## Prototypes Created

### 1. Material Design Starred Papers Interface (Success)
- **Branch**: `personal-page-prototype-1`
- **File**: `personal-page-prototype-1.html`
- **Design Dimension**: Design Language (Google Material Design)
- **Features**: Clean card-based layout, library statistics, folder organization, AI recommendations
- **Deployment**: Ready for Vercel deployment

### 2. Mobile-First Folder Structure (Success)
- **Branch**: `personal-page-prototype-2`
- **Directory**: `personal-page-prototype-2/`
- **Design Dimension**: User Type (Mobile-first vs web-first)
- **Features**: Tabbed interface, touch-friendly interactions, responsive design
- **Tech Stack**: React with mobile-optimized CSS

### 3. Command-Line Personal Library (Failure)
- **Branch**: `personal-page-prototype-3`
- **Directory**: `personal-page-prototype-3/`
- **Design Dimension**: Interaction Paradigm (Command line vs GUI)
- **Issues**: Poor readability, no visual hierarchy, limited interactivity
- **Learning**: CLI is unsuitable for personal library management

### 4. AI-Powered Personal Tutor & Recommendations (Success)
- **Branch**: `personal-page-prototype-4`
- **File**: `personal-page-prototype-4.html`
- **Design Dimension**: Interaction Paradigm (Conversational AI vs traditional GUI)
- **Features**: Chat interface, personalized recommendations, learning paths, library insights
- **Innovation**: AI tutor approach for research discovery

## Key Learnings

1. **Visual Organization is Critical**: Personal libraries need clear visual hierarchy and organization
2. **Mobile-First is Essential**: Researchers access their libraries on mobile devices frequently
3. **AI Integration is Powerful**: Personalized recommendations and learning paths add significant value
4. **Folder Structure Matters**: Clear categorization helps researchers organize and find papers
5. **AI Tutor Approach is Innovative**: Could revolutionize how researchers explore academic literature

## Design Dimensions Explored

1. **Design Language**: Material Design vs custom styling
2. **User Type**: Mobile-first vs desktop-first approaches
3. **Interaction Paradigm**: CLI vs GUI vs conversational AI
4. **Application Architecture**: Single-page vs multi-page vs chat-based interfaces

## Deployment

The Material Design prototype is configured for Vercel deployment with the included `vercel.json` configuration.
