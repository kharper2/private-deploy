# Research Graph Node Details Prototypes

This repository contains four rapid prototypes for the Query page Node details feature of the Research Graph application.

## Prototypes Created

### 1. Material Design Web Interface (Success)
- **File**: `prototype-1-material-design.html`
- **Design Dimension**: Design Language (Google Material Design)
- **Features**: Clean card-based layout, hover effects, responsive design
- **Deployment**: Ready for Vercel deployment

### 2. Mobile-First React Interface (Success)
- **Directory**: `prototype-2-mobile-react/`
- **Design Dimension**: User Type (Mobile-first vs web-first)
- **Features**: Tabbed interface, touch-friendly interactions, responsive design
- **Tech Stack**: React with mobile-first CSS

### 3. Command-Line Interface (Failure)
- **Directory**: `prototype-3-cli-failure/`
- **Design Dimension**: Interaction Paradigm (Command line vs GUI)
- **Issues**: Poor readability, no visual hierarchy, limited interactivity
- **Learning**: CLI is unsuitable for research paper exploration

### 4. Conversational AI Interface (Success)
- **File**: `prototype-4-conversational-ai.html`
- **Design Dimension**: Interaction Paradigm (Conversational vs point-and-click)
- **Features**: Chat interface, quick actions, contextual responses
- **Innovation**: Natural language interaction with research papers

## Key Learnings

1. **Visual Design Matters**: Material Design provides excellent readability and hierarchy
2. **Mobile-First Works**: Tabbed interface works well for mobile exploration
3. **CLI is Inappropriate**: Command-line interfaces don't suit research paper exploration
4. **Conversational UI is Promising**: Natural language interaction could revolutionize research discovery

## Deployment

The Material Design prototype is configured for Vercel deployment with the included `vercel.json` configuration.
