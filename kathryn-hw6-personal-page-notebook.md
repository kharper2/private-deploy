- [Screenshot 2: Folder Structure](personal-screenshot2.png)
- [Screenshot 3: Starred Papers](personal-screenshot3.png)

**AI Prompts Used**:
- "Create a Material Design interface for personal research library with starred papers, folder organization, and AI recommendations"
- "Design a clean card-based layout for displaying research papers with metadata, summaries, and action buttons"
- "Implement library statistics dashboard and folder management system with hover effects"

**Pros**:
- Excellent visual hierarchy for library organization
- Clean folder structure with clear paper counts
- Good use of Material Design components for consistency
- Comprehensive library statistics at a glance
- AI recommendations integrated seamlessly
- Responsive design works on different screen sizes
- Clear action buttons for paper management

**Cons**:
- May feel too "corporate" for personal use
- Limited customization options within Material Design
- Requires JavaScript for full interactivity
- Folder icons are emoji-based (not scalable)

**What I Learned**:
Material Design works excellently for personal library management. The card-based layout makes it easy to scan and organize papers. The statistics dashboard provides immediate value by showing library growth and activity. The integration of AI recommendations feels natural and helpful.

## Personal Page Prototype 2: Mobile-First Folder Structure (Success)

**Deployment Link**: [React App Deployment](https://your-react-app.vercel.app)

**Code Link**: [GitHub Repository - Branch: personal-page-prototype-2](https://github.com/your-username/hw6/tree/personal-page-prototype-2)

**Screenshots**:
- [Screenshot 1: Mobile Folders View](mobile-personal1.png)
- [Screenshot 2: Papers in Folder](mobile-personal2.png)
- [Screenshot 3: AI Recommendations Tab](mobile-personal3.png)

**AI Prompts Used**:
- "Create a mobile-first React interface for personal research library with tabbed navigation and folder management"
- "Implement touch-friendly folder browsing with paper details and quick actions"
- "Design AI recommendations interface with confidence scores and personalized suggestions"

**Pros**:
- Excellent mobile experience with touch-friendly interactions
- Tabbed interface reduces cognitive load
- Smooth navigation between folders and papers
- AI recommendations with confidence scores
- Bottom navigation provides easy access to different sections
- Progressive disclosure works well for complex library structures
- Quick actions for common tasks

**Cons**:
- Requires React build process
- Tab switching can feel slow on slower devices
- Limited space for paper summaries on mobile
- May be overkill for simple library management

**What I Learned**:
Mobile-first design is crucial for personal library management since researchers often access their libraries on mobile devices. The tabbed interface effectively organizes different aspects of the library (folders, recommendations) without overwhelming users. Touch interactions feel natural for browsing and organizing papers.

## Personal Page Prototype 3: Command-Line Personal Library (Failure)

**Code Link**: [GitHub Repository - Branch: personal-page-prototype-3](https://github.com/your-username/hw6/tree/personal-page-prototype-3)

**Screenshots**:
- [Screenshot 1: Terminal Library Stats](cli-personal1.png)
- [Screenshot 2: Folder Listing](cli-personal2.png)
- [Screenshot 3: Paper Details](cli-personal3.png)

**AI Prompts Used**:
- "Create a Python CLI tool for managing personal research library with folders, papers, and statistics"
- "Implement interactive menus for browsing folders and papers with JSON export functionality"
- "Add library statistics and paper management commands"

**Pros**:
- Fast for power users familiar with CLI
- Lightweight and doesn't require a browser
- Good for automation and scripting
- Can handle large amounts of text efficiently
- JSON export functionality for data portability

**Cons**:
- No visual folder structure - users can't see organization at a glance
- Poor readability for paper summaries and abstracts
- No way to visually compare papers side by side
- Difficult to browse and discover papers
- No support for visual elements like charts or graphs
- Limited interactivity for managing large collections
- No drag-and-drop or visual organization capabilities
- Poor user experience for researchers who need quick access
- No way to visualize paper relationships or citation networks
- Difficult to manage starred papers and recommendations

**What I Learned**:
CLI interfaces are completely unsuitable for personal library management. The lack of visual organization makes it impossible to quickly understand library structure and find papers. Researchers need visual cues, relationships, and rich formatting that only GUI interfaces can provide. Personal libraries are inherently visual and organizational in nature.

## Personal Page Prototype 4: AI-Powered Personal Tutor & Recommendations (Success)

**Deployment Link**: [AI Tutor Interface](https://your-ai-tutor.vercel.app)

**Code Link**: [GitHub Repository - Branch: personal-page-prototype-4](https://github.com/your-username/hw6/tree/personal-page-prototype-4)

**Screenshots**:
- [Screenshot 1: AI Chat Interface](ai-tutor1.png)
- [Screenshot 2: Paper Recommendations](ai-tutor2.png)
- [Screenshot 3: Learning Path](ai-tutor3.png)

**AI Prompts Used**:
- "Create an AI-powered personal research assistant with conversational interface and personalized recommendations"
- "Design a chat interface with embedded paper cards, learning paths, and library insights"
- "Implement contextual responses based on user's library and interests"

**Pros**:
- Natural language interaction feels intuitive for research discovery
- Personalized recommendations based on existing library
- Learning path generation provides structured guidance
- Contextual explanations help understand complex concepts
- Embedded paper cards maintain visual information display
- Sidebar shows library overview and quick access
- Can handle complex queries and follow-up questions
- AI tutor approach is innovative and engaging

**Cons**:
- Requires users to know what to ask
- May be slower than direct navigation for simple tasks
- Limited for users who prefer visual browsing
- Natural language processing complexity
- May not scale well with very large libraries

**What I Learned**:
AI-powered personal tutors show tremendous promise for research discovery. The combination of natural language interaction with embedded visual elements (paper cards, learning paths) provides the best of both worlds. This could revolutionize how researchers explore and organize their personal libraries by providing intelligent guidance and personalized learning experiences.
